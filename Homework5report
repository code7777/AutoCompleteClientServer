In this assignment I found sending the autocomplete results from the server to the client to be difficult.
I planned this assignment by first taking in arguments from main for the client and successfully sending them to the 
Server. After I got that step I had to open the file name in the server. After the file was opened in the server I tried to 
get it to match all of the prefixes for up to 7 results. I was not able to get the results from the server back to the client.

I learned about client and server models using sockets in Java. In operating systems we learned about how a buffer is flushed and
I got to see that implemented in a client server model in Java.
