# AutoCompleteClientServer

Optimized a search engine similar to a Google search autocomplete feature, which takes in a set of N
number of strings, then sorts the data in lexicographical order. Afterwards, a binary search is ran to find
matches to finish the word you are looking for. The data is sent from the server to client using Java sockets
